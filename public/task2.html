        <h3>A:</h3>
        <p>The first two examples will create the object "myPoint" with the properties "x","y" and "z" as one command.</p>
        <p>The last one will in the first line of code, create and empty Object named "myPoint"<br>
        Then it will execute 3 more lines that defines a property for the object</p>
        <h3>B:</h3>
        <p>First line: creates the object "myPoint"</p>
        <p>The next 3 lines defines properties in "myPoint"</p>
        <p>The nest lines defines a method in "myPoint" that will incease the value of "myPoint.z" with 5.</p>
        <p>The last two lines of code runs the method withing "myPoint" and then console.logs the changed property.</p>
        <h3>C:</h3>
        <p>The function createPoint, creates a javascript Object with 3 properties. The 3 properties are put in as object properties, and you also add a method. Finally the function return the created object.</p>
        <p>"myPoint1" = createPoint(23,12,10) will run the function as described above and "myPoint1" will then be a object with the properties x = 23, y = 12 and z=10, and a method for increasing the height of the z property.</p>
        <p>"myPoint2" = createPoint(45,17,22) works as described above but now with other x y and z values</p>
        <p>The third last line of code will run a method in the object myPoint1, witch increases the value of the z property with 5</p>
        <p>The last two lines console.logs the values of the to points "myPoint1" and "myPoint2". They should now be:</p>
        <p>myPoint1 = {x:23,y:12,z:15,increaseHeight:...method...}</p>
        <p>myPoint1 = {x:45,y:17,z:22,increaseHeight:...method...}</p>
